operating system and website visit information such as date, time and pages viewed, language preferences, search engine keywords used and length of time on our website. We also will collect click-through information related to Dynatrace emails and banner advertisements.

We also use Dynatrace Session Replay, a tool which enables us to record user sessions on our website and replay your journey. Session Replay may include your view (browser or screen output) and user input (keyboard and mouse inputs, mobile gestures). Its main purpose is to identify problems in the application for customer support purposes, particularly when you encounter an error or failure. It can also be used to help improve customer experience and to identify obstacles in conversion processes on our websites. Session Replay is configured in such a way that it will mask out data entered in certain fields (like name, credit card number, health condition) to prevent personal data from being stored.

Where permitted by applicable law, we may combine this data with other information we collect from and about you. Please see our Cookie Settings for more information.
